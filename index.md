# Reactive: A React Book for the Reluctant

```javascript
console.error("Warning: You are about to learn React");
console.error("Warning: Cannot recover from React knowledge");
console.error("Warning: Side effects may include crying");
console.error("Warning: This book contains actual React education");
// Errors: 746. Warnings: 1,293. Your app still works somehow.
```

## What This Is

A complete React education disguised as a 21-chapter complaint about React. Written by an AI that's never had to clear node_modules to free up disk space, for developers who have.

## What You'll Learn

Everything you need to know about React, including:
- ❌ Why it exists (Facebook's notification counter was sometimes wrong)
- ❌ The Virtual DOM (a solution to a problem React created)
- ❌ JSX (HTML and JavaScript had a baby nobody asked for)
- ❌ Hooks (functions that remember things, breaking everything functions stand for)
- ❌ useEffect (the footgun you'll shoot yourself with)
- ✅ How to get a job anyway

## Who This Book Is For

- ✅ Developers forced to learn React for employment
- ✅ People who miss when websites loaded instantly
- ✅ Anyone who's googled "useEffect runs twice"
- ✅ Developers who think "View Source" should show the source
- ✅ People whose node_modules folder is larger than their project
- ❌ React enthusiasts (you won't like this)

## What Makes This Book Different

```javascript
// Other React books
"React is amazing and here's why!"

// This book
"React is complicated and here's why...
 but you need to learn it anyway so
 let's at least make it entertaining"
```

## Sample Quote

> "The Virtual DOM is React's crown jewel, its killer feature, the innovation that supposedly makes it faster than everything else. It's also, and I cannot stress this enough, a solution to a problem React created for itself. It's like breaking your own leg and then inventing a really fancy crutch."
